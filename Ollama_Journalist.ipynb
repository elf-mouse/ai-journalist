      "Articles to reference: ['Dogs will be dogs. They will fetch, roll over, and beg. They will also chew, dig, and bark. Sometimes, they are cute, and sometimes, they are troublesome. Which canine behaviors are normal and which are problematic?\\n\\nHeritage and Behavior\\n\\nSome canine behaviors are innate. Long ago, dogs were bred to accomplish certain tasks. For example, a Border Collie may chase bikes because he was bred to herd sheep and wants to corral the bicycle. A Beagle may bark at a new scent or sound because she was bred to track and hunt. Some dogs repeat the survival skills of their ancestors that lived in the wild, so a Samoyed may dig a hole in the yard because he is trying to make a cool, comfortable bed outdoors.\\n\\nOften what we view as problem behavior is just a dog being a dog. But, if your dog digs in the flower bed, scares the neighborhood kids while they ride bikes, or disturbs your sleep by barking all night, the behavior is problematic. By examining some common dog behaviors and the instincts that underlie these behaviors, we can better understand how to defuse situations without punishing the dog for “doing what comes naturally.\"\\n\\nDegrees of Misbehavior\\n\\nIf your dog “misbehaves,\" try to rank his infractions. There are different levels of undesirable behavior.\\n\\n1. Behaviors within the normal range for the age and breed of dog. Some annoying behaviors are just plain normal. For example, chewing in pups is expected while they are teething. Pet parents need to effectively redirect this temporary behavior so it does not become a persistent problem. Offer them suitable chew toys that are considered high value so they focus there and not on your favorite running shoes or couch.\\n\\n2. Behaviors that lie within or just beyond the normal range. Some behaviors are challenging because, although they are considered normal, they may be harmful and difficult to manage. For example, it’s normal for dogs to mark their territory, but urinating on a new couch is a no-no. Understanding the basis of the behavior will help you deflect it. But you should have a realistic level of expectation. Cleaning up a little urine is part of being a dog owner.\\n\\n3. Behaviors that lie outside the normal range and are considered problematic. Some behaviors are definitely abnormal. Serious behavior disorders may be the result of emotional issues related to insufficient early socialization, medical conditions, or genetic predispositions. Behavior problems like fear aggression or resource guarding require working with professionals who can provide training guidance and behavioral modification medications when needed.\\n\\nFortunately, most common canine behavior problems fall into categories 1 and 2 and are temporary or manageable.\\n\\nCommon Behavior Issues\\n\\nWhen inherited behaviors pose a problem, find an outlet for the behavior that suits both you and your dog. Here are some common behavior issues that can be resolved or reduced so that human and canine family members live in harmony.\\n\\n1. Barking. Almost all dogs bark, and pet owners know that they must endure a little racket. However, excessive barking that disrupts the household or disturbs the neighbors is a problem. Determine why your dog is barking. If he barks to get your attention, he may be insecure. Ignore him until he stops, then reward his quiet time. If your dog barks when someone knocks on the door, he is instinctively guarding his territory. Shouting at him to hush fuels the frenzy. Talk to him in a soothing voice and reassure him that the intruder is not a threat. If your dog barks when you return home because he is excited to see you, ask him to sit and give him time to settle down before playing with him.\\n\\n2. Chewing. Chewing is natural for all dogs. Dogs examine the world with their mouths and may gently chew an object out of curiosity. Pups chew a lot because they have so many new things to examine. Plus, teething and chewing helps soothe sore gums. Unfortunately, some adult dogs chew when bored or excited and are destructive. Destructive chewing is an abnormal manifestation of a normal behavior. Try “doggie proofing” the house by placing items out of reach. Consider confining your dog to a crate when you are not around to supervise. Also, provide chew toys or high value rewards/treats such as stuffing a toy with some peanut butter or their kibble to give the dog an acceptable outlet for his chewing instinct.\\n\\n3. Digging. Dogs historically dig to carve out a good place to sleep or to bury their treasures. Digging removes small branches and stubble that make for an uncomfortable bed. In hot climates, moving the topsoil exposes underlying earth that is cooler to sleep on. Make sure your dog has a cool, comfortable spot to rest outside. Digging is normal unless your dog digs excessively out of anxiety or boredom and destroys the garden or injures his paws. To combat boredom, exercise your dog more. Increased physical activity may decrease digging. You can also try using deterrents (noxious odors, electric fences). Or, as a last resort, you can try to redirect the digging instinct by creating a digging area in the yard where you bury small treats. While not optimal, sacrificing a small portion of the yard may save the flower garden! If the root cause is anxiety related, you need to try to identify the trigger and consider using some medications while working on modifying the behavior.\\n\\n4. Chasing. A dog’s predatory or herding instinct precipitates the need to chase moving objects or people. This behavior puts both the chaser and the one being chased in peril. Train your dog to “freeze” on command and come when called. Keep him on leash when walking and be aware of potential triggers such as kids on bikes or joggers. Fill his need to chase by playing fetch in the safety of your own back yard.\\n\\n5. Biting. Pups may nip at other dogs or people as a result of inherited pack mentality while they learn their place in their pack or family. This is normal, but when biting extends beyond puppyhood or becomes harmful, it is abnormal behavior. Some dogs only bite when they are in pain, feel threatened or fearful, or are guarding their territory. These behaviors are understandable, but can still be harmful. Some dogs display dominance aggression and are simply dangerous. Constant owner vigilance, responsible breeding practices, early training, and socialization can reduce problem biting.', \"We’re quick to make assumptions about dog behavior based on the way our furry best friends look. But is a dog’s breed an accurate predictor of the way they’ll behave? It’s easy to assume that a dog’s breed is a genetic blueprint for the exact way a pup will turn out, especially given the detailed traits and characteristics that are part of every breed description. But what happens when you bring home a breed with a reputation for being a “confident, funny, and fearless” dog that turns out to be anything but? Is your pup an outlier, or is there more to a dog’s personality than what’s encoded in their genes?\\n\\nKey Takeaways A dog’s behavior is not guaranteed by breed alone.\\n\\nAccording to one study, a dog’s breed explains about 9% of their overall behavior.\\n\\nA dog’s overall life experience is a better predictor of the way they’ll interact with the world around them.\\n\\nDoes Breed Affect Behavior? Breed undoubtedly impacts aspects of a dog’s behavior—it’s part of the reason why we task Border Collies with herding and not Dalmatians. But according to one recent study, a dog’s genetic wiring might not weigh as heavily in their personality as once assumed. The study included more than 18,000 dogs and surveyed pet parents on topics that ranged from their dog’s sociability with other dogs and humans, to their dog’s ability to follow directions, to their dog’s interest in toys. The study determined that breed explains only about 9% of an individual dog’s behavior. It's important to recognize that the American Kennel Club’s breed personality descriptions describe the idealized dog of that breed—not a guarantee.\\n\\nPet Parent Expectations vs. Dog Behavior Pet parents often enter relationships with dogs, particularly purebred dogs, assuming how they’ll respond to the world around them. This inadvertently creates canine self-fulfilling prophecies. For example, if we buy into the idea that all Chihuahuas have a tendency to nip, we might write off the behavior as “just part of the package” if a Chi pup starts biting fingers when being picked up (a reaction many puppies might have), rather than take steps to mitigate the dog’s discomfort. Based on their breed description, we might also assume that every Labrador is easygoing and good with children, only to discover that a Lab that never had experience with kids might be skittish around them. Behavior is complicated and fluid, and while a dog’s breed certainly plays a role in the development of canine personality, the ways our dogs actually behave is based a combination of factors. It's important to recognize that the American Kennel Club’s breed personality descriptions describe the idealized dog of that breed—not a guarantee.\\n\\nWhat Affects a Dog’s Behavior? While there are aspects of a dog’s temperament that can seem hardwired, personality is a combination of nature and nurture. Factors that can impact the way a dog’s behavior develops include: Maternal influence: A mother dog’s behavior during weaning can impact a puppy’s willingness to interact with people. For example, skittish mothers might model behaviors that puppies adopt.\\n\\nThe amount and quality of early socialization: Puppies that are raised without frequent positive exposures to novel sights, sounds, locations, and beings might be less confident, easily startled, and slower to recover from stress.\\n\\nEnvironment: Dogs that grow up in households where all their needs are met will likely develop differently than dogs that live in deprived households, like those kept outside with minimal human contact.\\n\\nOngoing socialization as the dog matures: While early socialization is critical for developing confident and behaviorally appropriate puppies, socialization is a muscle that needs to be worked throughout a dog’s life. Adult dogs that don’t have opportunities for positive experiences with new environments and people might be less likely to react to the world confidently.\\n\\nLevel of daily exercise: Many behavioral challenges stem from a lack of adequate physical and mental exercise. Dogs that seem to be “hyper” or “naughty” probably aren’t getting enough exercise.\\n\\nTraining: Training is more than just a way to ensure polite behavior; it’s also a passport to the world, as well-trained dogs are usually able to feel comfortable in a variety of settings.\\n\\nDiet: Dogs that eat a balanced diet of healthy food will develop and behave differently than dogs eating lower-quality foods. Dogs that eat foods with too many fillers and artificial ingredients might be more likely to have energy peaks (like overexcitability) and crashes (like lethargy).\\n\\nCaregiver personality: We love our dogs because they’re such wonderful companions, and that bond between us can lead to our dogs mirroring our behavior. High-strung, nervous pet parents might wind up with a dog that has similar challenges. While there are aspects of a dog’s temperament that can seem hardwired, personality is a combination of nature and nurture.\\n\\nDog Breed and Behavior: The Big Picture Yes, dog personality is impacted by their genetic blueprint. But assuming that a set of breed characteristics is a guarantee of behavior does our dogs a disservice. Dogs are individuals, and honoring their quirks is a big part of being a good pet parent. A dog’s overall life experience is a better predictor of the way they’ll interact with the world around them than what their breed standards says. So if your Labrador hates the water or your Beagle has the world’s strongest recall, you can chalk it up to a combination of life factors, including their relationship to you. Featured Image: Adobe/Марина Колобанова\", 'The old adage, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”, can be directly applied to canine health care. Avoiding an illness is always better than treating it, and when it cannot be avoided, intervention is always more effective if started sooner rather than later. Since dogs age faster than humans, an annual veterinary exam with diagnostic testing is equivalent to a human visiting the doctor every four to five years. The rapid aging process of dogs makes preventive health care even more important.\\n\\nWhat are preventative healthcare guidelines?\\n\\nTo standardize veterinary care for dogs and cats, AAHA (American Animal Hospital Association) and the AVMA (American Veterinary Medical Association) gathered medical information from various specialty groups, some of which include the American Heartworm Society, American Association of Feline Practitioners, and Companion Animal Parasite Council, and devised the “Canine Preventive Healthcare Guidelines” (CPHG).\\n\\nWhat are the CPHG recommendations and why are they important?\\n\\nBelow is an overview of some recommendations included in the CPHG and how they relate to you and your dog:\\n\\nHistory. A discussion of your dog’s home life will give your veterinarian an overall idea of her health status. Changes in your dog’s demeanor may occur so gradually that you are not aware of them until you are asked specific questions. Does your dog have a good appetite and regular bowel movements? Does she strain to urinate? Does she limp? Is she slow to rise when lying down? Does she ever seem short of breath, cough, or sneeze? Is she itchy? Does she drink a lot? Your answers will be recorded at each visit so your veterinarian can identify changes that are otherwise difficult to notice on a day-to-day basis.\\n\\n\"Changes in your dog’s demeanor may occur so gradually that you are not aware of them...\"\\n\\nExaminations. Even healthy dogs should be examined by a veterinarian at least once a year, preferably twice a year. If your dog is older or has medical problems, more frequent visits may be necessary. Physical exams can detect heart murmurs or skipped heartbeats, enlarged lymph nodes, skin and/or abdominal tumor, and enlarged or shrunken kidneys, liver, or spleen that may indicate systemic disease. A look at the eyes can determine your dog’s visual capacity. An orthopedic evaluation can tell if your dog is arthritic and in need of pain medication. An evaluation of the skin and coat will determine the need for flea and tick control or diagnose skin infections (bacterial, fungal, or parasitic). Hair loss may indicate systemic disease or hormonal imbalances.\\n\\nTesting. Although heartworms are more prevalent in warmer climates where mosquitoes thrive, infected dogs live in every state and in many parts of Canada. Even dogs in cold environments can get heartworms, so The American Heartworm Society advises annual heartworm blood testing. Intestinal parasites can affect both dogs and humans, so a stool sample should be analyzed at least once (preferably twice) a year. To diagnose organ malfunctions in the early stages, blood tests (complete blood count, chemistry panel, and thyroid screen) and urinalysis should be performed annually. If problems are diagnosed, more frequent testing may be necessary. For dogs in areas where ticks are prevalent, screening for vector-borne diseases like Lyme disease or ehrlichiosis may be advised.\\n\\n\"...The American Heartworm Society advises annual heartworm blood testing.\"\\n\\nDental care. It is a well-known fact that oral health impacts a dog’s general health. Simply put, dogs with clean mouths live longer. The bacteria involved in periodontal disease do not just stay in the mouth. These organisms invade the bloodstream and travel to major organs like the kidneys, liver, and heart where they cause significant health issues. Dogs may need their teeth cleaned every one to two years, but this frequency can vary depending on several factors including preventive care and routine at-home maintenance (i.e., daily brushing). Dental radiographs (X-rays) will help determine the status of oral disease. Regular dental cleanings will keep your dog’s oral health in good condition.\\n\\nParasite prevention. Dogs should be given medication to prevent heartworms all year long in endemic areas. Many heartworm medications also prevent or treat intestinal parasites, and some may also treat fleas and ticks. Your veterinarian can provide these medications and a parasite prevention protocol can be tailored to your dog.\\n\\nImmunizations. Vaccinations are divided into two groups: core vaccines and non-core (optional) vaccines. All dogs considered stable and healthy to vaccinate should be immunized for rabies, distemper, canine parvovirus, and canine adenovirus-2 (hepatitis) (usually offered as a combined DAP vaccination). Vaccination for kennel cough, Lyme disease, leptospirosis, and canine influenza may be recommended for dogs with potential exposure to these diseases. See the “Vaccines for Dogs” handout for more detailed information.\\n\\n\"Research has shown that leaner dogs live longer and have fewer health problems.\"\\n\\nWeight maintenance. Research has shown that leaner dogs live longer and have fewer health problems. Your veterinarian will assign a body condition score to your dog and give you dietary and exercise recommendations to help your dog maintain a healthy body condition score. See the “Obesity in Dogs” handout to learn more about the importance of a healthy body condition score and how you can prevent obesity in your dog.\\n\\nSpaying/Neutering. Spaying or neutering can have numerous health or behavior benefits. Having this surgery done can prevent infections and some types of cancer. Your veterinarian will discuss these benefits and the timing of the surgery for your dog. In the meantime, see the handouts “Spaying in Dogs” and “Neutering in Dogs” to learn more about these procedures and how they can affect your dog.\\n\\nDiagnosing canine illnesses. Dogs have innate survival instincts that give them the ability to hide pain and illness well (so as not to seem vulnerable to predators). Since a veterinarian cannot simply ask your dog how she is feeling or see what is going on inside her body, thorough physical examinations with disease screening tests such as blood work and urinalysis can help your veterinarian determine if your dog is at risk for developing a condition that can still be prevented, or if a condition is already there, diagnose and treat it early.', 'If you’re a dog owner, you already know that this animal is capable of bringing untold joy and love into our lives. A dog’s loyalty is unmatched, and there’s nothing quite like coming home to an adorable creature that sees you as its whole world. Of course, being a dog owner also takes work and dedication. They need to be fed, washed, walked, and generally looked after in order to keep them healthy and happy.\\n\\nOne of the best things you can do for your furry friend as a dog owner is to ensure you’re keeping up-to-date with all necessary vet appointments. Why? Because a veterinarian is capable of screening your dog for a number of preventable health issues, and caring for them proactively before they become more serious problems.\\n\\nWhy take a preventative approach to dog health care?\\n\\nFor a long time, the health of our dogs was treated as more of an afterthought. Despite a shared history spanning millennia between humans and canines, only recently have we truly brought these beloved animals in as members of the family, and treated their well-being accordingly.\\n\\nWhereas previously, dog health conditions were simply a fact of life that may have cut a pup’s time with us short, veterinary research has allowed us to treat the health of our dogs much as we would treat humans. That’s why preventative care is so important—it means that issues can be detected and treated before they become serious, (or even life-threatening) which means a longer, happier life for your dog and many more years of good memories for their owners.\\n\\nAs indispensable members of our families, it’s only fair that we do our very best for our dogs. Let’s go through a few common dog health problems, and how preventative treatment can nip them in the bud and keep your dog safe and healthy for years to come.\\n\\n1. Obesity\\n\\nObesity is the most common health issue in our pet dogs. Approximately 60% of pet dogs are overweight or obese. Overweight dogs are predisposed to other serious health issues like arthritis, diabetes, and respiratory compromise.\\n\\nRegular check ups with your vet will allow for routine assessment of your dog’s weight, and if the veterinary team detects any increases in your dog’s weight we can address this as quickly as possible. The team will discuss any specific dietary changes needed to get your pet back into shape and the regular weight checks needed to ensure we are seeing positive progress.\\n\\nWeight loss can be challenging, and we are here to support your pet every step of the way!\\n\\n2. Parasites and Tick-borne Illnesses\\n\\nTick-borne illnesses and parasites such as heartworm can have very serious health implications for your dog. Thankfully, here in BC these health issues are fairly rare; however, we have many pets that are rescued from other countries where these health issues are a major concern. If your pet has traveled overseas, your vet will recommend testing to ensure that your pet does not have heartworm, lyme disease, anaplasma, and other serious illnesses.\\n\\nWe can protect your pet from heartworm, fleas, and ticks through the proactive use of medications. All that’s needed is a chewable pill or a topical solution administered monthly. Your veterinarian will be able to give you a prescription based on your dog’s age, breed, and size, providing peace of mind for years to come.\\n\\n3. Arthritis\\n\\nArthritis refers to inflammation and swelling of joints in key stress points of your dog’s body. The most common form of arthritis in dogs is osteoarthritis, which is typically seen in older dogs. Over time, this problem compounds and can lead to severe pain and lack of mobility. Although not strictly preventable, there are many things you can do to improve your dog’s odds of avoiding this painful and debilitating condition.\\n\\nIf your veterinarian suspects your dog is at risk of developing arthritis, they can make several recommendations on how best to improve the prognosis. Typically, the first step is weight loss, usually through a combined approach of adapted exercise and a specialized diet. Joint supplements will be recommended by your vet. Sometimes, anti-inflammatory prescriptions are also necessary in order to reduce your pet’s pain and keep them active.\\n\\n4. Infectious Diseases\\n\\nVisiting your vet clinic on a regular basis to keep your pet up to date on vaccines ensures that your pet is well protected from infectious diseases like parvovirus, distemper, and rabies. These diseases can be transmitted by other dogs and wildlife. Routine vaccination is our best preventative action against these deadly diseases. Annual vaccine appointments are also a great time to discuss any other preventative care your dog might require.\\n\\n5. Dental Disease\\n\\nDental care is a little recognized, yet necessary part of caring for your dog. By the age of three, 80% of all dogs show signs of dental disease, which can lead to the more serious problems of heart, lung, and kidney disease.\\n\\nDental disease can be prevented and treated. Daily brushing of your dog’s teeth and offering daily dental chews are something you can do at home to help keep their teeth in good health. At your dog’s annual check up, your veterinarian will perform an oral health assessment and might recommend a dental procedure.\\n\\nDental procedures are done under general anesthesia for the comfort and safety of your pet and include ultrasonic cleaning, polishing, fluoride treatment, and dental x-rays. They are key to preventing and treating dental disease in dogs.\\n\\n6. Cancer\\n\\nUnfortunately, the vast majority of us have been impacted by cancer in one way or another. Hearing that a loved one has contracted this dangerous and unpredictable disease can be completely devastating, and the same is absolutely true for our dogs.\\n\\nAlthough dogs can still develop cancer despite a healthy lifestyle, there is still hope. Veterinary research has allowed us to learn more about how and why cancer develops in dogs, and how best to prevent them moving forward. For instance, we’ve learned that certain breeds, such as boxers, terriers, and retrievers tend to run a higher risk of contracting cancer. (Source: ASPCA)\\n\\nAlthough not all types of cancer can be prevented, there are a few ways to improve your pup’s odds of avoiding certain kinds altogether. Spaying or neutering your pet as soon as safely possible is one great way to reduce their chances of getting cancer, particularly testicular or breast cancer. Furthermore, regular vet visits give your animal expert a chance to thoroughly screen your dog for cancer, meaning that smaller growths can be treated and removed before they become life-threatening.\\n\\nAs you can see, there are several health problems that dogs run the risk of encountering throughout their life. Thankfully, there’s almost always something you and your veterinarian can do in order to be proactive and preemptive about their health.\\n\\nCreative Commons Attribution: Permission is granted to repost this article in its entirety with credit to Hastings Veterinary Hospital and a clickable link back to this page.', \"Finding out your dog has a health problem can be scary for pet parents. The good news is, there are plenty of treatment options for most conditions that can keep your dog happy and healthy.\\n\\nIn this article, we'll cover:\\n\\nFactors that contribute to dog health problems\\n\\n15 common dog health problems (and treatment options)\\n\\nHow to keep your dog happy and healthy\\n\\nFactors that contribute to dog health problems\\n\\nDogs experience health issues for different reasons. Some pups are more prone to disease and illness than others. Here are some factors that can play a role in common dog health problems:\\n\\nAge : Like humans, aging can affect your dog’s health. Older dogs and young puppies are more likely to develop health problems because their immune systems are weaker than healthy, middle-aged dogs.\\n\\n: Like humans, aging can affect your dog’s health.

So, be sure to take your pup in for regular check-ups to stay on top of their health and wellness.\\n\\n15 common dog health problems and treatments\\n\\n1. Fleas\\n\\nFleas and flea infestations can affect you and your dog if left untreated. Fleas spread easily between non-treated animals. And, they can be tricky to get rid of.\\n\\nIf your pet has a flea problem, they may show signs like itching and redness on their skin. This is because fleas bite your dog’s skin to suck their blood.\\n\\nFleas can also carry diseases that can be harmful to your pet. And, flea season isn’t just during the warmer months. When the weather gets colder, fleas can find shelter inside your house year-round.\\n\\nSUGGESTED TREATMENT\\n\\nFlea and tick prevention is the best way to protect your pup from flea infestations. Protect your pet every month with a treatment in one of these forms:\\n\\nTopical treatments\\n\\nOral medications\\n\\nWearables (flea collars)\\n\\nTalk to your vet about which method of flea and tick treatment is best for your dog.\\n\\n2. Intestinal parasites\\n\\nInternal parasites can infect your dog and lead to life-threatening conditions. Most parasites typically spread through:\\n\\nInsect bites\\n\\nIngestion\\n\\nContaminated surfaces\\n\\nFecal matter\\n\\nThe most common types of parasites found in dogs are hookworms, roundworms, and tapeworms.\\n\\nHookworms\\n\\nHookworms are one of the most common parasites found in dogs. Hookworms live in your dog’s intestines and can cause serious health conditions like anemia, weakness, lung damage, and pneumonia.\\n\\nRoundworms\\n\\nRoundworms can stunt young puppies’ growth and development. And, they can cause other issues like gastric upset.\\n\\nRoundworms do not need an intermediate host to spread from dog to dog. This means your dog can contract roundworms from direct contact with an infected dog.\\n\\nTapeworms\\n\\nTapeworm spreads from dog to dog through intermediate hosts like fleas or rodents. An abundance of tapeworms in your dog’s system can lead to intestinal blockages — a life-threatening condition for your pup.\\n\\nSUGGESTED TREATMENT\\n\\nThere are different treatment methods for different parasites. External parasites have a different treatment plan than internal parasites. Plus, some cases are more severe than others.\\n\\nIn serious cases, intestinal blockages require surgical removal. Deworming medication can treat other, less serious conditions.\\n\\nSome parasites are difficult to prevent. But, your dog can get vaccinations to protect them against parasites. Some forms of heartworm prevention protect your dog from heartworms, roundworms, and hookworms.\\n\\n3. Heartworm disease\\n\\nHeartworm infection spreads through infected mosquitoes that bite your dog. If your dog has heartworm infection, they may experience symptoms like:\\n\\nA mild, persistent cough\\n\\nReluctance to exercise\\n\\nFatigue after light exercise\\n\\nDecreased appetite\\n\\nWeight loss\\n\\nHeartworm in dogs is a serious condition and can lead to heart failure, lung damage, and even death. That’s why getting your dog tested for heartworm every 12 months and protecting them with heartworm prevention 12 months a year is important.\\n\\nSUGGESTED TREATMENT\\n\\nThe best protection against heartworm disease is through monthly prevention. Heartworm prevention works retroactively to stop the development of heartworm larvae.\\n\\nIf your dog is already infected with heartworm disease, treatment looks a bit different. A series of injections with antibiotics and surgical removal are the most common treatments for an infected dog.\\n\\n4. Oral health issues\\n\\nWhen your pet eats, food adheres to their teeth and gets lodged along the gum line. Over time, the buildup of food and plaque can harden and turn into tartar. This can be an issue for your pet, because tartar buildup is difficult to remove. It can also cause bad breath and dental disease.\\n\\nDogs are susceptible to many different oral health issues, including:\\n\\nBad breath\\n\\nPeriodontal disease\\n\\nDental disease\\n\\nBad breath\\n\\nBad breath in dogs can come from their diet or a larger, more serious health issue. The best way to learn where the smell is coming from is by talking to your vet as soon as possible.\\n\\nPeriodontal disease\\n\\nPeriodontal disease is another name for gum disease in dogs. Excessive buildup of plaque and tartar causes periodontal disease.\\n\\nDental disease\\n\\nDental disease is most common in older dogs and can lead to other fatal infections in your dog’s heart, kidneys, and liver.\\n\\nSome breeds are more susceptible to dental disease and oral health issues than others. Smaller dogs typically have a higher risk of dental disease due to their small teeth that are difficult to clean.\\n\\nSUGGESTED TREATMENT\\n\\nGetting your dog’s teeth cleaned by a professional every few months can help keep their teeth and gums healthy. Or, you can brush your dog’s teeth at home with a pet toothpaste and finger brush.\\n\\nIn addition, you can supplement your pup’s dental care routine with dental gels, bones, treats, or chews. Be sure to choose a dental product that is safe for your dog’s breed, size, and age.\\n\\n5. Allergies\\n\\nLike humans, many dogs can experience allergy symptoms. Every type of allergy has different triggers. And, there are many ways to treat each type.\\n\\nThe most common types of dog allergies include:\\n\\nFood allergies\\n\\nEnvironmental allergies\\n\\nSkin allergies\\n\\nSeasonal allergies\\n\\nWhen dogs have allergies, they may have symptoms like chewing and licking their paws, itching, sneezing, or respiratory infections.\\n\\nSUGGESTED TREATMENT\\n\\nPet owners can treat some of their pet’s allergy symptoms with over-the-counter medications like Benadryl and Claritin. Ask your vet which medicines are right for your pet’s condition.\\n\\nMore serious allergies need stronger medication prescribed by a vet. When you bring your pet in for a check-up, your vet may suggest a prescription medication to relieve their symptoms.\\n\\nAllergy shots can be helpful to build immunity against specific allergens in your dog’s environment. Although costly, allergy shots can help relieve symptoms and keep your dog itch- and sneeze-free for longer periods of time.\\n\\n6. Skin infections and hot spots\\n\\nHot spots and skin infections can leave your dog feeling itchy and cause red, flaky skin. Your dog’s fur and skin may even stink if they have an infection.\\n\\nThis health problem is fairly common for dogs, but skin infections typically indicate an underlying health issue. Common causes of skin infections includes:\\n\\nEnvironmental allergies\\n\\nFood allergies\\n\\nSkin parasites\\n\\nEndocrine diseases\\n\\nSUGGESTED TREATMENT\\n\\nIf your dog has a skin infection, flush and clean the affected areas on their skin. Antibacterial pet soaps and shampoos can help soothe your pup's skin and reduce irritation.\\n\\n7. Ear infections\\n\\nBacteria, ear mites, and fungus cause ear infections in dogs. If your dog has an ear infection, they may have symptoms like:\\n\\nScratching their ears\\n\\nTilting or shaking their head\\n\\nWobbling when they walk\\n\\nRedness\\n\\nSwelling\\n\\nSUGGESTED TREATMENT\\n\\nIf your dog has an ear infection, visit your vet for a diagnosis. Your vet may prescribe special ear drops or antibiotics to treat your dog’s condition.\\n\\nThere are also things dog owners can do to help prevent ear infections from happening in the first place. After splashing in the pool or lake, be sure to dry your dog’s ear canal thoroughly with a towel.\\n\\nIf your pup is prone to ear infections and spends a lot of time in water, try dog ear plugs. Regular ear cleanings are another way to prevent ear infections.\\n\\n8. Kennel cough\\n\\nKennel cough is a respiratory illness spread between dogs in close quarters. Young puppies and older dogs are most susceptible to kennel cough.\\n\\nSUGGESTED TREATMENT\\n\\nWhen your dog reaches six weeks of age, they are eligible to receive a Bordetella vaccination at the vet. This vaccination is the strongest defense against kennel cough.\\n\\nIf your pup has Bordetella, your vet will prescribe a medication to treat their condition. In healthy adult dogs, Bordetella is typically not life threatening.\\n\\nConsistency is important to stay protected against kennel cough. Adult dogs should get Bordetella booster vaccinations every six to twelve months to prolong protection through their adult life.\\n\\n9. Hip and joint issues\\n\\nHip and joint issues in dogs can appear in different forms, and are caused by different triggers. Dogs can develop hip and joint issues from:\\n\\nAging\\n\\nInjury\\n\\nGenetics\\n\\nBreed predisposition\\n\\nThe most common hip and joint issues dogs experience are arthritis and hip dysplasia.\\n\\nArthritis\\n\\nWhen the cartilage that protects your dog's joints starts to deteriorate, your dog may develop arthritis, also known as degenerative joint disease.\\n\\nMost dogs with arthritis experience other symptoms like:\\n\\nPain\\n\\nInflammation\\n\\nLethargy\\n\\nWeight gain\\n\\nDecreased range of motion\\n\\nBone spurs\\n\\nHip dysplasia\\n\\nCanine hip dysplasia is the abnormal development and growth of a dog's hip joint. It causes a hip deformity in dogs that leads to hind-end pain, stiffness, and weakness.\\n\\nSUGGESTED TREATMENT\\n\\nThere are plenty of methods for treating hip dysplasia and other joint issues in dogs. Adding a hip and joint supplement to your dog’s diet can help prolong their joint health. If your dog is already suffering from hip and joint issues, physical therapy and acupuncture can help relieve your dog’s symptoms.\\n\\nCOMMONLY AFFECTED BREEDS\\n\\nHip and joint issues most commonly occur in large-breed, active dogs. Large dog breeds can have excessive growth rate hormones which cause them to grow faster than other breeds.\\n\\nBut, joint issues can also affect smaller breeds and cats. Some commonly affected breeds include:\\n\\nGolden Retrievers\\n\\nGreat Danes\\n\\nMastiffs\\n\\nGerman Shepherds\\n\\nLabradors\\n\\nSaint Bernards\\n\\nBoston Terriers\\n\\nPugs\\n\\nLarge mixed-breed dogs\\n\\n10. Obesity\\n\\nObesity occurs when your dog has an abundance of body fat. If your dog isn't fed a healthy diet or lacks a regular exercise routine, they may be at risk of developing obesity.\\n\\nAccording to VCA Animal Hospitals, dogs are obese when they weigh more than 20% above their ideal body weight. Obesity can shorten your dog’s life and make them more susceptible to diseases and dog health issues like diabetes, hip and joint problems, and cancer.\\n\\nSUGGESTED TREATMENT\\n\\nVisiting your vet for regular body condition assessments can ensure your dog is maintaining a healthy weight for their age, size, and breed. Feeding your dog with nutritional food and providing regular exercise can also help maintain their body weight.\\n\\n11. Stress and anxiety\\n\\nPast experiences and stressful environments or situations can trigger stress and anxiety in dogs. Whether it’s exposure to a new environment or adding a new pet to your household, dogs can experience stress and anxiety just like humans.\\n\\nIf your dog is in distress, they may show other symptoms like:\\n\\nPacing or shaking\\n\\nWhining or barking\\n\\nYawning, drooling, and licking\\n\\nHair loss\\n\\nExcessive panting\\n\\nChanges in bodily functions\\n\\nSUGGESTED TREATMENT\\n\\nIf your dog is feeling stressed, there are ways to help keep them calm. Calming treats, anti-anxiety medication, and natural calming products can be quick fixes to help your dog calm down. For chronic conditions, special training can help your dog feel less anxious day-to-day.\\n\\n12. Heart disease\\n\\nHeart disease in dogs is either developed or present at birth. It affects your dog’s ability to exercise, eat, and live a healthy life. Pets often live for many months without showing symptoms. That's why the disease is difficult to detect.\\n\\nSUGGESTED TREATMENT\\n\\nBecause it is difficult to detect, be sure to bring your dog to the vet for regular dog check-ups. If your dog has heart disease, your vet may suggest treatment options that are right for your dog’s condition. Serious cases of this condition may require surgery, while diet changes can treat mild cases.\\n\\n13. Urinary tract infections (UTIs)\\n\\nUTIs are fairly common in dogs. Female, diabetic dogs and dogs with bladder stones are more likely to develop a urinary tract infection. Giant breeds are also more susceptible to UTIs.\\n\\nHere are some common symptoms of urinary tract infection in dogs:\\n\\nStraining to urinate\\n\\nCrying out while urinating\\n\\nBlood in urine\\n\\nSUGGESTED TREATMENT\\n\\nYour vet will suggest a treatment method depending on your dog's case. Diet changes, medication, and supplements are all common treatments for UTIs in dogs.\\n\\n14. Kidney disease\\n\\nKidney disease is most commonly associated with aging. Large dogs may experience kidney disease at an earlier age than small dog breeds.\\n\\nSUGGESTED TREATMENT\\n\\nTreatment of kidney disease depends on the severity of the case. In serious cases, treatment can be ineffective. But, if a case is caught early, dogs can live a normal, healthy lifestyle for many months or years with medicinal treatment.\\n\\n15. Cancer\\n\\nCancer is the result of the uncontrolled growth of cells in the body. If these cell growths are not found quickly, the condition can worsen quickly and affect other areas of your dog’s body.\\n\\nThere are a variety of cancers that dogs can develop. The most common types of cancer in dogs include:\\n\\nHemangiosarcoma\\n\\nMast cell tumors\\n\\nLymphoma\\n\\nMelanoma\\n\\nCancer is the leading cause of death for dogs 10 years of age and older. But, some forms of cancer in dogs are treatable if caught early.\\n\\nSUGGESTED TREATMENT\\n\\nSeveral factors come into play when choosing a treatment method for cancer in dogs including your dog’s:\\n\\nAge\\n\\nGeneral health\\n\\nCancer type\\n\\nCancer stage\\n\\nTreatment for cancer in dogs is similar to treatment for cancer in humans. Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery are the most common ways to treat it. If your dog has cancer, your vet can suggest a treatment plan that is right for your dog’s condition.\\n\\nHow to keep your dog happy and healthy\\n\\n1. Get routine vet exams.\\n\\nRegular dog check-ups can help you stay ahead of any potential dog health issues. Pet parents should bring their dog to the vet for a check-up every year for testing and vaccine boosters (if needed).\\n\\n2. Stay on a consistent vaccination schedule.\\n\\nVaccinations protect your dog from otherwise avoidable dog health issues. Plus, they help keep other dogs and pets safe from diseases.\\n\\nHere are the core vaccines dogs need:\\n\\nRabies\\n\\nCanine distemper\\n\\nParvovirus\\n\\nDHPP\\n\\n3. Feed your dog a healthy diet.\\n\\nYour dog’s diet is a contributing factor when it comes to keeping them healthy. Pet parents should feed their dogs a proper diet. Depending on any food allergies or sensitivities, you may need to make adjustments to their meals.\\n\\nYou can also supplement your dog’s diet with a multivitamin supplement. Supplements can help your dog get all the nutrients they need (and may not be getting in their food).\\n\\n3. Maintain good health care and treatments.\\n\\nStaying up-to-date on your dog’s medications and monthly treatments can keep them healthy and prolong their life. Brush your dog's teeth regularly, make sure they get regular exercise, and protect them from fleas, ticks, and heartworms every month.\\n\\n5. Cover your expenses with pet insurance.\\n\\nEmergency vet visits and procedures can be costly out-of-pocket. Pet insurance helps cover big expenses up front so you can focus on taking care of your pet.\\n\\nThere are plenty of pet insurance providers for pet parents to choose from. Talk to your insurance agent about which pet insurance coverage plan is right for you.\\n\\nTreating your pup’s health problems doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Be proactive and stay on top of any potential issues with regular check-ups and the right pet care products.\", 'The old adage, \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\" certainly holds true when it comes to pet health. The cost of prevention is often a fraction of the cost of treating a disease or problem once it has become more advanced, and early diagnosis and treatment of developing problems or diseases can increase the likelihood of successful outcomes.\\n\\nPreventive healthcare involves a multi-faceted approach that includes veterinary evaluation of your pet\\'s overall health and risks of disease or other health problems.

We have to give a second thought before we make a decision to training a dog.\\n\\nSo, How dogs are trained?\\n\\nWe all know, even it is true that training a dog is one of the toughest things to do, even there is a risk if misleading it. So this is confusing to decide which way should take to train your dog.\\n\\nI have one, so I know how it feels if anything bad happens to our dog.', \"Top 10 Dog Training Tips\\n\\nWritten by Small Door's medical experts\\n\\nOne of the most important and rewarding things you can do as a pet parent is to train your dog well, but it’s often hard to know how to get started. Since January is national Train Your Dog Month, we thought we’d share some handy tips to help you and your pup get going.\\n\\n1. Use positive reinforcement techniques\\n\\nAlmost all vets agree that positive reinforcement training is the most effective method of dog training. Positive reinforcement training essentially focuses on rewarding your pet for good behavior, rather than punishing bad behavior.\\n\\nWhenever your dog demonstrates good behavior and responds positively to your commands, reward them! By rewarding good behavior, you’re reinforcing the association between good behavior and good things.\\n\\nIt’s also important to make sure you’re not inadvertently rewarding unwanted behavior. For example, if your dog barks at you to play or jumps up to say hello, don’t acknowledge it or give in, as this just reinforces the bad behavior. Instead, wait until they’re calmer before giving them attention.\\n\\n2. Find the right reward.\\n\\nSome dogs are food-motivated, and will respond very enthusiastically to any sort of edible treat as a reward. Others are pickier: often, soft, chewy treats are preferred to hard, crunchy ones.\\n\\nSome dogs, however, just aren’t that interested in food at all. If this is the case with your pup, try experimenting with other rewards, like a quick play session with a favorite toy, or even just plenty of affection.\\n\\n3. Consistency is key.\\n\\nBeing consistent in your training is incredibly important. This includes consistency in how you’re training your dog—for example, always using the same word, and even the same kind of intonation, when asking them to do something.\\n\\nEqually important is for everyone in your household to be on the same page. Dogs need consistency to learn new habits, so if you never let the dog on the couch, but your partner does, your pup will just end up confused.\\n\\n4. Train little and often.\\n\\nShort training sessions repeated throughout the day are much more effective than longer ones. The American Kennel Club recommends keeping sessions to five minutes maximum ; any longer and your dog may become distracted or frustrated.\\n\\nDogs also often struggle to generalize commands to other places or situations (i.e., understanding that asking for a “sit” at home is the same thing as a “sit” on a busy street), so it’s useful to repeat your training sessions in multiple locations, with different people and with varying levels of distraction, so that your pup learns to respond correctly to the same command all the time.\\n\\n5. Build up in stages.\\n\\nStarting small can be helpful, particularly when it comes to more complex behaviors like “stay,” or with behavior modification (when you’re trying to get rid of unwanted behavior).\\n\\nTry breaking behaviors down into smaller parts. For example, in the beginning, if you’re training “come,” praise and reward your dog when they take even one step towards you. It’s much easier to add on steps and build up to the whole behavior once your pup starts to get the hang of it.\\n\\n6. Make it fun.\\n\\nTraining should be fun, both for you and your dog! Always keep it positive, and try mixing things up to keep it interesting, such as incorporating short play sessions into your training in between repetitions.\\n\\nYou could also consider training your dog to do tricks in addition to regular obedience training. As humans, we naturally respond more enthusiastically to seeing a dog rolling over than we will to a plain old sit—our dogs pick up on that enthusiasm and end up loving to perform tricks for us!\\n\\nIt’s easy to get caught up in the end goal of training, but remember to praise your dog for any small improvement.\\n\\n7. Praise the small things.\\n\\nRemember to always praise your dog for any improvement, no matter how small. It’s easy to get caught up in the end goal of training, but celebrating the little wins is just as important, and will help keep both you and your dog motivated.\\n\\n8. Work training into daily life.\\n\\nBy making training part of your usual pet routine, it’s a lot easier to fit in many small sessions. For example, ask your dog to sit or respond to another command before you give them their dinner, take them out for a walk, or play with them.\\n\\n9. Use your hands.\\n\\nMuch as we’d wish they could, dogs can’t understand language the same way we do. Many dogs respond better to hand signals than verbal commands, so try combining the two, or even begin with only hand signals and add the verbal command later.\\n\\n10. Consult a dog trainer or attend a training class.\\n\\nIf you’re struggling, don’t hesitate to contact a professional dog trainer or join a training class. Generally one of the fastest ways to get results, professional trainers have years of knowledge they can use to help you and your pup. They will have experienced many different types of problems in their career, so they should have ideas on how to address any issues you may be facing.\\n\\nWhen choosing a trainer, take your time to do a little research. Make sure they use positive reinforcement techniques, and read plenty of reviews or get references if you can.\\n\\nWe host regular puppy training classes at Small Door – reach out to our team for more details!\", 'There are so many popular dog training methods out there that it can be frustrating to find out which is which and what method is going to be best for both your dog and you as a pet parent.\\n\\nIf you find it overwhelming and confusing, you’re not alone. There is even a great deal of disagreement within the professional dog training community about which methods are effective and ethical, and several methods overlap or are used in tandem for the best results.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHere are seven of the most popular dog training methods used today and who might benefit most from using them.\\n\\nPositive Reinforcement\\n\\n(Picture Credit: Getty Images)\\n\\nPurely positive reinforcement is a method popularized by trainers like Dawn Sylvia-Stasiewicz, who trained the Obamas’ dog, Bo.\\n\\nThe theory behind it is fairly straightforward. Dogs will repeat good behavior when it’s followed by a reward. Bad behavior does not get a reward or acknowledgement. If correction needs to happen, it comes in the form of removal of rewards, like a toy or treat being taken away. Harsh reprimands or physical punishments aren’t necessary.\\n\\nThis training method begins with rewarding a desired behavior immediately, within seconds after it happens. That way, the dog comes to associate the behavior with the reward.\\n\\nSome trainers combine this method with clicker training (see number three below). This gives the dog a distinct sign of the exact moment the behavior was completed. Commands also need to be short and to the point. Sit. Stay. Come.\\n\\nPositive reinforcement requires consistency. Therefore, everyone in your household needs to use the same commands and reward system.\\n\\nStart with continuous rewards every time your dog does the right thing. Then, gradually move to intermittent rewards as the behavior becomes consistent. Sometimes beginner trainers accidentally reward bad behavior. For example they might let the dog outside when they start barking at a squirrel or another dog.\\n\\nOnly wanted behaviors get rewards, which can include treats, toys, praise, and pets. It can also be easy to overfeed when your dog is learning, so use small treats when you are rewarding with food.\\n\\nThis method is great for learning commands, but you need patience for correcting unwanted behaviors.\\n\\nScientific Training\\n\\n(Picture Credit: Getty Images)\\n\\nScience-based dog training can be difficult to define, as it relies on information that is continually building and changing. It aims to understand dogs’ nature, their ability to be conditioned, and the effectiveness of rewards and punishments.\\n\\nAnimal behaviorists are constantly creating new studies and experiments to shape our understanding of dog psychology. Trainers rely on these studies to work with dogs. Before a behavior is corrected, everything about that behavior must be understood.\\n\\nBecause science-based dog training is so broad, it’s hard to pinpoint an overarching methodology behind it. In fact, a lot of the methods used in scientific dog training are used by other forms of training.\\n\\nFor the most part, there is a reliance on operant conditioning, which mostly includes positive reinforcement and, less often, some forms of punishment.\\n\\nSome scientific trainers believe that it’s also important to learn how to strengthen good behavior without the need for rewards and to rely on dog psychology to find ways to improve off-leash relationships between humans and their pups.\\n\\nScientific training relies on doing a good deal of research and staying updated on the latest studies. For that reason, it may be best for professional trainers, since the methods they use are often effective whether you know the science behind them or not, and other forms of training already employ many of those methods.\\n\\nAlso, developing new methods based on research may not be appropriate for everyone. Still, it’s a good idea for dog parents to stay informed and pay attention to new research when it becomes available.\\n\\nClicker Training\\n\\n(Picture Credit: Getty Images)\\n\\nClicker training is also based on operant conditioning and relies heavily on the same principles as positive reinforcement. In fact, clicker training may be grouped in as a method of positive reinforcement, rather than as its own form of training.\\n\\nIt relies on the use of a device to make a quick, sharp noise, such as a whistle or, as the name suggests, a clicker to signal to a dog when a wanted behavior is accomplished.\\n\\nThe advantage of using clicker training is that it signals the exact moment the desired behavior is finished and exactly what is being rewarded. Trainers can then use the clicker to shape new behaviors and add verbal commands.\\n\\nFirst, the dog needs to be conditioned to know that a click means a reward is coming. Then the dog can associate a behavior with a click and a reward. Finally, the verbal command can be introduced to form a new association.\\n\\nThis is a great method for learning new tricks, and it can help shape the basics into more complicated tasks. Many professional trainers use this method.\\n\\nWhile it is great for learning new behaviors, clicker training isn’t necessarily well-suited for curbing unwanted behaviors. When used alongside other training methods, it can be very effective in making sure you have a well-trained, well-behaved pooch.\\n\\nElectronic Training\\n\\n(Picture Credit: Getty Images)\\n\\nElectronic training relies on the use of an electric collar that delivers a shock or a spray of citronella when a dog is not performing a desired task. It’s mostly used for training at a distance when a leash can’t be used.\\n\\nFor example, shock collars can train a dog to stay within boundaries of an un-fenced yard. Remote collars can teach dogs to work in fields or do hunting work. People who use these devices claim that there’s less risk of a dog getting hurt than with choke collars or other mechanical devices.\\n\\nThere are many problems with this training method. One is that it relies on punishment for bad behavior instead of rewards, meaning a dog learns what they shouldn’t do, rather than what they should do.\\n\\nAnother problem is that it can create a great deal of stress and lead to permanent anxiety issues for dogs. The devices are often used by inexperienced pet parents, and therefore are overused. This can cause a lot of unnecessary pain, both physically and psychologically, for dogs.\\n\\nProfessional dog trainers may see desired results from electronic training, but it’s definitely not for use by average pet parents. There are many alternatives that put dogs under far less stress and pain.\\n\\nIf you’re going to use an electronic device, consult a professional about proper use, and consider an alternative form of behavior correction.\\n\\nModel-Rival Or Mirror Training\\n\\nThe model-rival method of training relies on the fact that dogs learn by observation. By providing a model of good behavior or a rival to compete for resources, dogs learn to mimic behaviors.\\n\\nSo a trainer might have another human act as the model, praising them for completing tasks on command or scolding them for unwanted behavior. The dog, as an observer, learns what to do correctly from the model.\\n\\nThe model can also act as a rival, competing to do the right task for a desired toy or treat as a reward, encouraging the dog to pick up on the task and accomplish it more quickly.\\n\\nMirror training relies on the same principle, using the dog parent as a model, then offering rewards for mimicking good behavior. It uses the dogs natural instincts to operate socially instead of working against them. To put it simply, the dog learns by example.\\n\\nThis training method operates with a similar level of success as positive reinforcement and operant conditioning. However, some trainers may find it more natural and preferable.\\n\\nIf your dog has a strong bond with you and can spend a lot of time observing you and following you around, this may be a technique that you find more comfortable than sticking to regular training sessions.\\n\\nAlpha Dog Or Dominance\\n\\n(Picture Credit: Getty Images)\\n\\nAlpha dog or dominance training relies on a dog’s instinctual pack mentality to create a relationship of submission and dominance.\\n\\nThe theory suggests that dogs see their families as their packs and follow a social hierarchy, as observed in captive wolf packs. When a dog sees themselves as the alpha, they need to learn to instead respect their human as the alpha and submit.\\n\\nSome methods used in this technique include understanding dog body language and responding accordingly, projecting confidence and authority, and going first when it comes to eating, entering or leaving rooms, or walking on leash.\\n\\nIf your dog wants to go out, then they have to sit before you open the door. If they want to eat, then they have to wait calmly while you prepare food.\\n\\nGenerally with alpha training, you don’t allow your dog on furniture with you, including the bed. You also don’t get down to your dog’s eye level. That’s because these are signs that your dog has equal standing in the relationship. You are in charge; you are dominant.\\n\\nCesar Millan popularized this training method. However, he sometimes combines dominance training with other methods when appropriate.\\n\\nSome modern trainers say this technique is outdated, as new research has shown that dogs do not rely on pack mentality as much as previously thought, and the pack dynamic of wolves isn’t structured in the wild the same way it was when the animals were observed in captivity.\\n\\nAlthough dominance training can curb unwanted behaviors, modern dog trainers often find it antiquated. It can fail to address the underlying causes of bad behavior and leave dogs feeling anxious or fearful.\\n\\nThe dominance struggle becomes constant and needs consistent reinforcement, which can be difficult or even dangerous for children or the elderly.\\n\\nRelationship-Based Training\\n\\n(Picture Credit: Getty Images)\\n\\nRelationship-based training combines several different training methods, but focuses on a more individualized approach for both dog and human. It is the relationship between dog and human that drives everything.\\n\\nThis method strives to meet the needs of the dog and the trainer, to foster communication, and to strengthen their bond. Basically, it’s about being mutually beneficial.\\n\\nThe person must know how to read their dog’s body language, what rewards most motivate their dog, and how to meet their dog’s basic needs before each training session begins. Positive reinforcement encourages good behaviors.\\n\\nThe dog’s environment is controlled to limit possible unwanted behaviors. New information is built on previous success.\\n\\nFor example, a dog must learn to “sit” in a quiet room before trying to perform the command in a park with squirrels and kids and other distractions. Difficulty increases gradually.\\n\\nWhen a dog doesn’t perform the desired behavior, the human must figure out why instead of punishing. Is the dog focusing on distractions? Hurt? Unable to hear? Or just unwilling to perform?\\n\\nThis relationship-based training leads to a deep and meaningful bond, but it takes time and patience. It may not have enough to differentiate it from other training methods, but rather seems to be inclusive of many aspects of other successful methods.\\n\\nYou may find that your relationship with your dog improves regardless of which training method you use, and certainly that bond will help you continue your training.\\n\\nWhat dog training method works best for you? Are there any other methods that you find helpful? Let us know in the comments below!', 'Dog Training Career\\n\\nDog training is a lucrative vocation for anyone seeking a rewarding career working with canines. Being a Dog trainer enriches the lives of dog parents by providing a structured method for them to interact with their fluffers and waggers and vice versa. Not only can you provide a significant positive impact for entire families by training a once-aggressive pooch, but you can also provide much needed structure for said pooch to thrive in.\\n\\nWhen dogs know their place in the pack, it creates calmer and happier pets.\\n\\nHowever, just like any training program, Dog training has its differences in methods and applications.\\n\\nFocusing on positive rewards is one popular style, but there are many regimens you can choose from when selecting your preferred training approach.\\n\\nIf you’re interested in learning about effective methods of Dog training, you’re barking up the right tree.\\n\\nLet’s get started chewing through this delicious bone of knowledge by clearing up the confusion about Dog training styles.\\n\\nHere are the most popular methods of Dog training:\\n\\n(Although we’ve broken down training methods into specific categories, the reality is that trainers often blend styles together.)\\n\\nAlpha Dog (Dominance) Method (Compulsion)\\n\\nPositive Reinforcement Clicker Training\\n\\nScientific Training Classical Conditioning\\n\\nElectronic Training\\n\\nModel/Rival (Mirror) Training\\n\\nRelationship-based Training\\n\\nYou can also break down Dog training into the following overarching theories:\\n\\nTraditional Dog Training\\n\\nModern Dog Training\\n\\nBalanced Dog Training Respect Training\\n\\n\\n\\nA third way to break down Dog training styles according to research:\\n\\nReward Based\\n\\nPunishment Based\\n\\nNeutral\\n\\nWith such a diverse taxonomy of training methods, it is understandable why there is so much debate about the best and most effective dog training approaches.\\n\\nScientifically speaking, the types of Dog training are not black and white, but instead fall on the ‘Dog Training Spectrum.’\\n\\nYour best bet when choosing a training style may be to learn the basics of each and build your own hybrid technique.\\n\\nBATTLE OF THE STYLES\\n\\nThere is much controversy and debate between members of different training schools.\\n\\nAs we investigate these training styles, we’ll also mention any known criticisms to give you the most balanced view possible.\\n\\nLet’s dig in!\\n\\nALPHA DOG (DOMINANCE) METHOD (COMPULSION TRAINING)\\n\\nThis method, popularized in part by Cesar Milan, relies on teaching the dog that you are the pack leader. For example:\\n\\n“If your dog wants to go out, then they have to sit before you open the door. If they want to eat, then they have to wait calmly while you prepare food.”\\n\\nSome modern trainers believe that this training method is outdated in light of new research on pack mentality.\\n\\nAlso called ‘Compulsion’ training, this is the oldest method of Dog training that exists.\\n\\nPOSITIVE REINFORCEMENT TRAINING\\n\\nPositive Reinforcement has been touted by celebrities such as Victoria Stilwell of Animal Planet’s TV show It’s Me Or The Dog, as well as Dawn Sylvia-Stasiewicz, who trained the Obamas’ dog Bo.\\n\\nThe overall approach for this type of training is that owners reward desired behavior with treats such as food, and do nothing when the dog exhibits undesirable behaviors such as barking or biting.\\n\\nClicker training is a type of positive reinforcement training that uses an audible ‘click’ to reward desired behaviors in dogs. There are lots of great dog clickers on the market. So, you wont have much trouble finding one that’s durable, ergonomic and loud enough for a dog to hear.\\n\\nSteven R. Lindsay (author of \\u200bApplied Dog Behavior and Training\\u200b\\u200b) explains that “rewards lead to greater active strategies, such as searching, exploring, and risk taking. In contrast, punishment tends to lead to hesitation, ritualization, and risk avoidance as well as generally more passive behaviors.”\\n\\nThere are numerous critiques of positive-only training, with the most common being that it doesn’t work as well for submissive dogs and generally doesn’t help eliminate undesirable behavior.\\n\\nSCIENTIFIC TRAINING\\n\\nScience-based Training blends classical conditioning and operant conditioning.\\n\\nThere are some positive rewards, but also negative punishments.\\n\\nSome researchers believe you should also condition dogs to behave properly without rewarding them each time.\\n\\nScience-based training is too broad to categorize accurately, as new studies are always coming out to alter the landscape of this training style.\\n\\nELECTRONIC TRAINING\\n\\nThe lay-term for this is known as ‘shock collar training,’ although collars containing a spray of Citronella can also be used.\\n\\nThis training is best used at a distance, when the dog’s proximity to the owner is far and a leash can’t be used effectively.\\n\\nStudies indicate that this causes a great deal of stress to dogs subjected to this method of training.\\n\\nMODEL/RIVAL (MIRROR) TRAINING\\n\\nThis method is based on the idea that dogs learn by observing.\\n\\nTrainers will use other humans (or the owner) as models for completing desired behavior and being rewarded for it.\\n\\nThis is the ultimate version of ‘learning by example.’ The method works best when the dog already has a strong bond with its owner, which makes it more likely to follow suit by learning from its owner’s actions.\\n\\nRELATIONSHIP BASED TRAINING\\n\\nThis method is a hybrid of other training styles that relies on the connection between the dog and its owner.\\n\\nRelationship-based training requires more patience from both parties, as its basis is building on the dog’s current successes.\\n\\nOne manifestation of this style is to thoughtfully consider why the dog is behaving in an unwanted fashion, and addressing the root cause of this instead of just punishing the dog into compliance.\\n\\nWhat about the meta breakdown of Traditional, Modern, and Balanced Dog training?\\n\\nTRADITIONAL DOG TRAINING\\n\\nThe ‘traditional’ approach would encompass the Alpha Dog (Dominance) Method – showing the dog it’s place in the pack.\\n\\nSome examples of this type of training would be to eat before the dog or walk through doorways before the dog.\\n\\nHowever, modern research has shed light on the fact that dog packs would rarely organize themselves into such a rigid, coherent system.\\n\\nThese studies have paved the way for new strategies often called ‘modern’ dog training.\\n\\nMODERN DOG TRAINING\\n\\nThe Modern approach incorporates Positive Reinforcement, Science-based Training, and subsets of each such as Clicker Training and the positive elements of Classical or Operant Conditioning.\\n\\nThe modern approach focuses on reinforcing positive behaviors rather than directly ‘correcting’ bad ones.\\n\\nBALANCED DOG TRAINING\\n\\nThis method incorporates both of the previous styles – both the negative corrections and positive rewards of Classical or Operant Conditioning.\\n\\nA balanced Dog trainer may use a clicker when the dog is just a puppy (positive), but also correct unwanted behaviors with punishments once the dog matures.\\n\\nMost balanced Dog trainers use both methods because of the assumption that positive reinforcement alone is not enough.\\n\\nSome Dog trainers are now calling for the method to be called ‘Crossover’ training, as they feel that using ‘balanced’ terminology is misleading in that it presupposes a better approach than positive reinforcement only.\\n\\nSays Bob Maida, who trained Ronald Reagan’s dogs:\\n\\n“I hate using the term (alpha dog) because it’s a buzzword that prompts the ‘positive crowd’ to near criminalize people that correct dogs,” Maida says. “You need balance. It’s like cooking – if you put too much salt in the dish, it’s not going to taste good.”\\n\\nNow that you’ve learned about some popular Dog training methods – which one will you apply in your puppy bootcamp?\\n\\nDid we miss anything?

      "Title: The Evolution of Dog Training: A Journey from Dominance to Positive Reinforcement\n",
      "\n",
      "As the world continues to evolve, so too must our understanding of dog training. Gone are the days of dominance-based methods that relied on fear and punishment to shape canine behavior. Today, trainers and owners alike are embracing a more compassionate approach, one that prioritizes positive reinforcement and rewards good behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what exactly is this new wave of dog training? And how does it differ from its predecessors? To answer these questions, we must first delve into the history of dog training and explore the various methods that have emerged over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Traditional Approach: Dominance-Based Training\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, many trainers subscribed to a dominance-based approach, one that posited that dogs needed to be shown their place in the pack. This method, often referred to as the \"Alpha Dog\" approach, relied on fear and punishment to shape canine behavior. Trainers would use techniques such as yelling, physical punishment, and even food withholding to correct undesirable behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, modern research has shed light on the fact that dog packs do not organize themselves into rigid, hierarchical systems. In reality, dogs are highly social animals that thrive on cooperation and mutual respect. As a result, many trainers have come to question the effectiveness of dominance-based methods and the harm they can cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Modern Approach: Positive Reinforcement\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, positive reinforcement has emerged as a popular alternative to traditional dominance-based training. This approach focuses on rewarding good behavior rather than punishing bad behavior. Trainers use treats, praise, and affection to encourage desired behaviors, thereby creating a positive association with the actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clicker Training, for example, is a type of positive reinforcement that uses a small device called a clicker to mark desired behaviors. When the dog performs the desired action, the trainer clicks the clicker and immediately rewards the behavior with a treat. This approach has been shown to be highly effective in shaping canine behavior and building strong bonds between dogs and their owners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Science-Based Training\n",
      "\n",
      "Another approach that has gained popularity is science-based training. This method combines classical conditioning and operant conditioning principles to shape canine behavior. Trainers use techniques such as desensitization and counterconditioning to help dogs overcome fears and phobias, while also using positive reinforcement to encourage desired behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Electronic Training: The Controversial Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "Some trainers have turned to electronic training methods, which involve the use of devices such as shock collars or Citronella sprays. While these methods can be effective in certain situations, they have been criticized for causing stress and discomfort to dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Model/Rival (Mirror) Training\n",
      "\n",
      "Another approach that has gained popularity is model/rival training. This method is based on the idea that dogs learn by observing and imitating others. Trainers use themselves or other humans as models to demonstrate desired behaviors, while also providing positive reinforcement for the dog's efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relationship-Based Training: The Holistic Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, some trainers have adopted a more holistic approach, one that focuses on building strong relationships between dogs and their owners. This method, often referred to as relationship-based training, emphasizes patience, understanding, and compassion. Trainers work with owners to identify the underlying causes of undesirable behaviors and develop strategies to address them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Benefits of Positive Reinforcement\n",
      "\n",
      "So why has positive reinforcement become so popular? For one, it is a more humane approach that prioritizes building strong bonds between dogs and their owners. By focusing on rewarding good behavior rather than punishing bad behavior, trainers can create a positive association with the actions, leading to stronger, more resilient relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, positive reinforcement has been shown to be highly effective in shaping canine behavior. Dogs are more likely to repeat behaviors that are rewarded than those that are punished, making it an ideal approach for training.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Drawbacks of Dominance-Based Training\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, dominance-based training has been criticized for causing harm and stress to dogs. By relying on fear and punishment, trainers can create a negative association with the actions, leading to anxiety, aggression, and even fear-based behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, dominance-based training often relies on outdated theories about canine behavior and social dynamics. In reality, dogs are highly social animals that thrive on cooperation and mutual respect, making it an ineffective approach for building strong relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Evolution of Dog Training\n",
      "\n",
      "As we look back on the history of dog training, it is clear that our understanding of canine behavior and social dynamics has evolved significantly over time. From dominance-based methods to positive reinforcement approaches, trainers have come to recognize the importance of compassion, patience, and understanding in shaping canine behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the evolution of dog training has been a journey from dominance-based methods to positive reinforcement approaches. By prioritizing building strong relationships between dogs and their owners, trainers can create a more compassionate and effective approach to training. Whether you are a seasoned trainer or just starting out, it is clear that the future of dog training lies in embracing positive reinforcement and building strong bonds with our canine companions.\n",
